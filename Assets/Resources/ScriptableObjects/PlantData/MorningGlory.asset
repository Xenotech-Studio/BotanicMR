  BotanicalName: Ipomoea nil
  Description: 'Annual or perennial vine, the whole plant has short hairs. Therefore,
    morning glories are generally planted in spring and bloom in summer and autumn.
    They come in many varieties and are common ornamental plants. The fruit is ovoid
    and can be used in medicine.

    Each morning glory flower has only a short
    lifespan of one day, usually blooming in the early morning and gradually closing
    by noon, hence they are also called "Asagao" (morning face).'

  Tutorial:
  - Description: Before sowing seeds in a pot or hanging basket, ensure that the
      bottom of the pot has holes. This step is crucial to protect the seeds or prevent
      seedlings from rotting due to poor drainage. A common technique is to place
      some pumice, perlite, or gravel at the bottom of the pot, then add soil on
      top to improve drainage and aeration.
    ShortDescription: Use a shovel to scoop soil into the pot
  - Description: Generally, large-flowered plants need extra space to expand. We
      can leave morning glory seeds on the surface rather than burying them deep
      into the soil.
    ShortDescription: Place the morning glory seeds on the soil surface
  - Description: Morning glories are climbing plants, which means they will need
      a trellis to twine around and grow upwards. Typically, a long stick inserted
      into the soil is sufficient. Morning glory seeds need light to germinate, so
      you can sow them in a sunny location.
    ShortDescription: Place the trellis in the flower pot

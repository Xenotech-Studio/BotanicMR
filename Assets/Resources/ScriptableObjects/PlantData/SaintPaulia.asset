  Name: African Violet
  BotanicalName: Saintpaulia ionantha
  Description: 'African violet is a dicotyledonous plant with fine hairs covering
    the entire plant. The flowers have a diameter of about 2-3 centimeters, and the
    number of petals is usually four, five, or a multiple thereof. A characteristic
    of this genus is that when the leaves are cut off, they can grow roots in water,
    leading to an entire new plant. Therefore, propagation is often done by cuttings.

    African
    violets were named "Saintpaulia" after Baron Saint Paul, who discovered them,
    because they attracted attention at the Royal Botanic Garden in Germany, hence
    the alternative name "Saint Paul flower."'
